# Credit Score Prediction Project

Welcome to our **Credit Score Prediction** project! 🚀 This project applies **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques to predict individual credit scores, aiming to improve the fairness, accuracy, and interpretability of financial decision-making.

---

## 📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on building predictive models for credit score classification using:
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and CatBoost.
- **Deep Learning Model:** A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) implemented with TensorFlow/Keras.

Our goal was to compare traditional ML models with a neural network approach and to deploy a robust, user-friendly credit prediction system.


## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle - Credit Score Classification Dataset
- **Size:** 100,000 records
- **Features:** 28 attributes, including Annual Income, Outstanding Debt, Credit Utilization Ratio, Number of Delayed Payments, etc.


## 🔥 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - KNN Imputation for missing values
   - Chi-Squared Test for feature selection
   - One-hot encoding and feature scaling

2. **Model Training:**
   - Evaluated multiple ML algorithms
   - Tuned hyperparameters manually
   - Implemented a custom deep learning model with ReLU, Batch Normalization, and Dropout layers

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score

4. **Deployment:**
   - Trained models saved as `.pkl` files
   - Flask-based web app developed for real-time predictions


## 🏆 Results

| Model | Accuracy |
|:---|:---|
| Logistic Regression | 64% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 73% |
| Naive Bayes | 62% |
